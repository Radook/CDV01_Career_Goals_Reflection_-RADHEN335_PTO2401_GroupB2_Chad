    - Anything front end based i really want to get into, career wise.
      
2. **Alignment with Personal Profile**:
  
    - The career paths im looking for all reflect on my more artistic creative parts of me, such as the css along with the ui/ux dev. Thus most the areas i want to explore to help gain more skills on that are any courses or guides to help
       me improve the skills needed for those careers.
    - I am positive i can achieve this after a year and have enough skills to get into a junior or entry job for front end

1. **Short-term Goals** (Next 1-2 years):
      
    - By the end of the year i want to have the skills and knowledge to finally start working in the front end dev path, and with this course, having full stack can help me achieve this.
    - i want to start working and start earning proper money with a job that i want to enjoy by, max, middle of next year, but hoping to get some sort of work with it by around Jan/Feb
    - All this is so i can work a nice paying job that allows me to be creative, problem solve and live a hopefully fairly non finiancial stress life.
2. **Long-term Goals** (3-5 years and beyond):
    
    - i want to be out the country around 3-5 years and hopefully by then have a senior role in any sort of front end or UI/UX field.
    - Hopefully with a little bit of luck and networking, i can achieve this goal in this span.
